# WebsiteEngine
A little website engine in Java to provide easy routing with vanilla websites (without NodeJs etc.)

## How To Use
There is a file named **settings.json** in the resources directory. There is an example for defining routes. The root directory is **public** folder.

## Notes
Currently, you cannot define the port and default port is 3000. So once you start the server, you can try it by connecting to localhost:3000 on your browser.

This project can be used as a library for making backend servers without huge frameworks like Spring or JSP (never lol).
